When pasting markup containing block level elements (like paragraphs or headers) into
an editable, that does not allow block level elements, AlohaEditor unwrapped the contents,
which resulted in consecutive text blocks (without visible line break).
This has been fixed now, so that after each unwrapped block level element a <br> tag will be inserted to
retain the line breaks.
