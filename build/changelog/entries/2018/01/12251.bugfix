The initial snapshot of editables were taken too early (before plugins were initialized),
which sometimes caused the editables to be marked as "modified" right from the start (before any actual changes were done by editors).
This has been fixed now.
Also the format plugin will now trigger @aloha-smart-content-changed@ events when formatting is changed.
