Block plugin: When clicking into an already active editable inside a block, the block was activated again and the scope was changed
to "block" and then to "text" again, which caused the toolbar to switch to the default tab for "text" (which normally is "Format"),
even if another tab was active before.
This has been changed now, if the block is already active, it will not be activated again, and the scope will not be changed, so that
the currently active tab will not change.
